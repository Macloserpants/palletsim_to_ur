## 1. Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that the following are installed on your system:

### 1.1 Installation of Python

1. Download and install the latest version of Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Ensure that the Python installation is added to your system's PATH.
3. Verify Python installation by running the following in the command prompt or terminal:

   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

### 1.2 Virtual Environment Setup (With venv)
Set up a Python virtual environment for dependency management.

```bash
cd path/to/your/project
```
Create a new virtual environment using the following command:

```bash
python -m venv myenv
```
To activate the virtual environment, follow the instructions based on your operating system:

- #### Windows:

```bash
myenv\Scripts\activate
```
- #### macOS/Linux:

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

If you encounter errors/issues with activating the virtual environment, refer to the next section.

### 1.2.1 Bypass Errors When Accessing myenv/Scripts/activate in PowerShell
If you encounter an error while trying to activate the virtual environment in PowerShell, follow these steps:

Open PowerShell.

Run the following command to bypass the execution policy temporarily:

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process

.\myenv\Scripts\activate
```

This will allow you to activate the virtual environment without encountering script execution policy errors

### (TO-DO) 1.2.2 Installation of Dependencies in venv
Once your virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all dependencies listed in your project's requirements.txt file.

### 1.2.3 Upload .urp file on UR robot
1. Copy the provided .urp program to a USB.

2. Plug the USB into the UR teach pendant.

3. Navigate to Program > Load > USB and select the .urp file.

4. Modify IP address in the script to match your PCâ€™s IP (used for TCP communication).

## 2. Steps to Run Python Program

### 2.1 Setup

#### 2.1.1 Connect Ethernet from PC to Robot
Use a direct Ethernet cable and connect it from PC to robot.

#### 2.1.2 Change Ethernet IP Address

#### On your PC:

1. Open Control Panel > Network and Sharing Center > Adapter Settings

2. Right-click Ethernet > Properties > IPv4

3. Set a static IP (e.g., 192.168.1.100)

4. Set Subnet Mask to 255.255.255.0

#### On your UR Robot

1. Open Hamburger Menu (Top Right corner) > TODO > Network 

2. Select and set Static IP

3. Set robot IP the same for first 3 IP blocks "192.168.1.XXX". 

   - X value can be any other value other than the one that was used for the PC (100)

3. Set Subnet Mask to 255.255.255.0

4. Ensure it says "_Network is Connected_" 

#### Verify establishment of network connection 

Verify the connection via the PC for Windows/macOS/Linux using Command Prompt/Terminal respectively and type in:

```bash
ping 192.168.1.XXX
```

A successful connection will show a reply.  
An unsuccessful connection will "Request timed out" or there are Lost/no Received packets.
